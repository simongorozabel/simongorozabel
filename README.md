### Hi, I'm Simon ðŸ‘‹

I've enjoyed web development since I built my first HTML and CSS project, "a blog".

I'm looking for a front-end UI/UX web development role, ideally writing code in React. 

I'd especially love to work at a startup in a tight-knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on re-designing the front-end of @kalmansforge
