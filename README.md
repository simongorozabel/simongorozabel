## Hi, I'm Simon 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Full-Stack Development of a Driving Application.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React-Native and Business Implementation.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to lift weights so I can eat more peanut butter with cacao, bananas, and oatmeal.

### My journey

- 🎁 I've enjoyed technology since I was 12 years old playing Minecraft to automate everything in survival mode without cheat codes.
- 💻 I've enjoyed software development since I built my first HTML and CSS project, "a blog" in 2020.
- 🤔 I'm looking for a challenging role, ideally with a greater vision. 
- 👯 If you're hiring, let's chat!
