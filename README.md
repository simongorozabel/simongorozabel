## Hi, I'm Simon ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the front-end UI/UX of a Venture Studio startup at kalmansforge.com
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning WEBGL implementation with THREE.js and some React frameworks like @drei and @fiber
- âš¡ Fun fact: Sometimes I walk alone in the park and meditate on a bench

### My journey

- ðŸ’» I've enjoyed web development since I built my first HTML and CSS project, "a blog" in 2020.
- ðŸ¤” I'm looking for a front-end UI/UX web development role, ideally writing code in React. 
- ðŸ‘¯ I'd especially love to work at a startup in a tight-knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
